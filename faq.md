        <button class="accordion-header" type="button" aria-expanded="false">What is the AI & Global Development Lab?</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <div class="accordion-body">
            We are an interdisciplinary research group that fuses AI with Earth Observation data to study global development. Our work spans poverty mapping, conflict analysis, and sustainability measurement. We operate across three institutions: UT Austin, Linköping/Chalmers, and Harvard.

      <div class="accordion-item">
        <button class="accordion-header" type="button" aria-expanded="false">What makes your approach different?</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <div class="accordion-body">
            While many groups use satellite imagery for prediction, we focus on causal inference—understanding not just what is happening, but why. We develop methods for planetary-scale causal analysis that help identify what drives change and what interventions work.

        <button class="accordion-header" type="button" aria-expanded="false">What time period does your data cover?</button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
          <div class="accordion-body">
            Our satellite imagery analysis extends back to 1984, leveraging the Landsat archive. This allows us to study long-term trends in poverty, conflict, and environmental change—not just current conditions.
