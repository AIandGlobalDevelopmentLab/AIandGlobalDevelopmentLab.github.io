## Mission

The AI & Global Development Lab builds tools to see development as it unfolds. We turn decades of Earth Observation data into clear, timely measures of poverty, conflict, and environmental change—at local scale, worldwide.

Measurement is not enough. We develop methods for planetary-scale causal inference that separate signal from noise and help explain why outcomes shift. Our work connects machine learning, statistics, and the social sciences to support decisions that stand up to scrutiny.

We operate at the intersection of methodological innovation and applied impact, creating open-source tools that researchers and practitioners can use to answer their own questions.

## Lab Sites

The AI & Global Development Lab operates across three institutions:

**UT Austin** — Department of Government
Austin, Texas, USA

**Linköping University & Chalmers University of Technology** — Institute for Analytical Sociology
Linköping and Gothenburg, Sweden

**Harvard University** — Department of Statistics
Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA

This distributed structure enables collaboration across disciplines and time zones, combining expertise in political science, sociology, statistics, and computer science.

## Funding

Our research is supported by grants from academic institutions and research foundations. We are grateful to our funders for enabling open, reproducible research.

## History

The lab grew from long-running collaborations between Connor Jerzak, Adel Daoud, and Xiao-Li Meng, who began working together on methods for combining satellite imagery with survey data. What started as methodological work evolved into a broader research program on AI-assisted measurement and causal inference for global development.

Today, the lab includes researchers and students at multiple institutions, united by a shared interest in rigorous methods and real-world impact.
